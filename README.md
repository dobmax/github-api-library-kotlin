## Overview
The GitHub API Library Kotlin is a powerful tool designed to streamline and simplify development workflows by providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the GitHub REST API. This library serves as a bridge between your applications and the GitHub platform, offering developers a seamless experience when integrating [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) features into their projects.

### Key Features:

**Intuitive Interface:** The library offers a clean and intuitive interface that abstracts away the complexities of the GitHub REST API. Developers can easily perform common operations such as creating repositories, managing issues, and handling pull requests with just a few lines of code.

**Authentication Handling:** Seamless integration with GitHub's authentication mechanisms ensures secure access to the API. Developers can effortlessly handle authentication tokens and manage user permissions without getting bogged down by the intricacies of the authentication process.

**Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to provide meaningful feedback in case of API request failures. This enables developers to identify and troubleshoot issues efficiently, enhancing the overall reliability of their applications.

**Customizable Requests:** The library supports a wide range of GitHub API endpoints and allows developers to customize requests based on their specific needs. Whether retrieving repository information, fetching user data, or interacting with the Git data API, the library provides flexibility and extensibility.

**Pagination Support:** Efficient pagination support is built into the library, enabling developers to retrieve large sets of data from the GitHub API without compromising performance. This is particularly beneficial when working with repositories or organizations with a substantial amount of content.

**Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is available, offering detailed explanations of the library's functionality, code examples, and best practices. This ensures a smooth onboarding process for developers looking to integrate GitHub features into their applications.
